      <h1>Phases of the game</h1>
      <br><hr><br>
      <p>
        A game of chess is divided into three distinct phases, known as the <b>Opening</b>, 
        the <b>Middlegame</b>, and the <b>Endgame</b>, each of whitch has its own strategies (although 
        there are many strategies that apply equally to all three). Not every game will 
        feature all three stages - sometimes a game ends in the opening or the middlegame 
        without ever reaching an endgame, and sometimes a game can go straight from the 
        opening to the endgame with scarcely a middlegame at all.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>The Opening</h1>
      <br>
      <p>The opening in chess covers the first 10 to 15 moves of the game, in which both players 
        are moving their pieces from their starting positions to take up active posts ready to do 
        battle in the middlegame. Because the opening always starts from the same position, a large 
        body of opening theory has built up over the years. Many chess openings have their own names, 
        such as the Queen's Gambit or Sicilian Defence. You don't need to know what the openings are 
        called to get started in chess, though. Below is an example of the opening phase:</p>
      <br>
      <!-- <div class="phases opening"></div> -->
      <br>
      <h2>The Middlegame</h1>
      <br>
      <p>It can be difficult to pinpoint the exact transition from opening to middlegame, but as a general 
        rule it occurs once the pieces have been deployed from their starting squares and the kings have 
        castled to safety. The middlegame is often considered the most exciting phase of the chessgame. 
        It is in this stage of the game, after the opening has finished but while there are still plenty 
        of pieces on the board, that the king is in the most danger and must be carefully defended from 
        attack. Below is an example of a middlegame position:</p>
      <br>
      <!-- <div class="phases middle"></div> -->
      <br>
      <h2>The Endgame</h1>
      <br>
      <p>If neither player achieves a knockout blow in the middlegame, the game will eventually reach the 
        endgame. This is the stage of the game when most of the pieces have been captured and only a few remain. 
        As with the opening, it can be difficult to pinpoint the transition between middlegame and endgame. 
        Some players will call any position without queens an endgame, while for others the endgame is only 
        reached when the players have only one or two pieces other than pawns left on the board. Usually, 
        the players don't have enough pieces left to easily checkmate the opponent's king, so strategy in 
        the endgame generally revolves around getting a pawn to the other side of the board to make a queen. 
        Here is a typical endgame position:</p>
