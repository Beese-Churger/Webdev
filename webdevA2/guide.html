            <p>Chess is a turn based strategy board game played between 2 players on an 8x8 chequered board. Each player
                picks a side either black or white and the main objective is to trap your opponents king which is called
                a Checkmate, the player can either win through a checkmate, draw or by resigning.</p>

            <p>The player with the white pieces goes first and every subsequent turn the players will take turns to play
                a move. Each turn, the player has to move 1 piece to a new square. There are 6 unique pieces in Chess
                and each piece has their own unique moveset and properties which we will go into detail later. To
                capture an opponent piece, simply move your piece onto the square occupied by your opponent and remove
                it from the board granted it is a legal move.</p>

            <h1>The board</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The board must always be placed so that each player has a light coloured square in their bottom right
                hand corner. Placeing the board the wrong way round is a very common mistake. Once it is the right way
                round, we can start adding the pieces. Each player's pieces start on the first rank on that player's
                side of the board.(horizontal rows are called ranks)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ranks are labelled below as letters, the top being A all the way down to H, and coloumns have their
                numbers 1 to 8. This way each square on their board has their own id making it easier to represent moves
                in text.</p>
            <br>
        </div>
    

        <div class="chessboard label"></div>

            <br>
            <h1>Recording a move</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Each pieve is represented by the capitalised first letter of its name except for the Knight as it starts 
                with the same letter as the king so it uses the letter <b>N</b> instead. When recording a move, we take 
                the pieve that is being moved and the square that it is moving to.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Kf1</b> - King moves to f1 square</li>
                <li><b>Nf3</b> - Knight moves to f3 square</li>
                <li><b>Pe4</b> - Pawn moves to e4</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>When a piece captures another piece it is repsented as an <b>'x'</b> symbol between the piece and the square. 
                So it would be <b>Nxf3</b>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When a pawn reaches the end of the board an promotes it is represented as an <b>'='</b> symbol between the 
                piece and the square.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For check and checkmate a <b>'+'</b> and <b>'#'</b> are used respectively after the square so <b>Ba3+</b> or 
                <b>Qxh7#</b>.</p>

        <h1 id="pawns">Piece introduction: Pawns</h1>
        <br><hr><br>
        <br>
        <p>The pawn is seemingly the weakest of the bunch. However, its role in Chess is not to be
            underestimated. Each player starts the game with eight pawns on the second rank.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard p1"></div>
        <br>
        <h2>Pawns: Movement</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Except on its first move, the pawn is only allowed to move one square forwards, and never 
            backwards. On its very first move, a pawn has the choice of moving one or two squares, 
            although both squares must be unoccupied to do this. On all subsequent moves, the pawn 
            can move one square only, even if it only moved one square on its first turn - it only 
            has one chance to move two.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard p2"></div>
        <br>
        <h2>Pawns: Capturing</h2>
        <br>
        <p>If the square directly in front of a pawn is occupied, the pawn is blocked and cannot move 
            forwards. Unlike all the other pieces, a pawn does not capture the same way it moves. Instead, 
            a pawn captures by moving one square diagonally forward. In the diagram below, the white pawn 
            cannot capture the black pawn directly in front of it, but it may capture the black knight by 
            moving one square diagonally forward. Try it for yourself - drag the white pawn onto the black 
            knight to capture it!</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard p3"></div>
        <br>
        <h2>Pawns: Promotion</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The most important feature of pawns is their ability to promote when they reach the opposite side 
            of the board. If your pawn gets all the way to the opponent's back rank, it is immediately promoted 
            to a more powerful piece - take the pawn off the board, and replace it with a new piece of your choice. 
            The only restriction is that you cannot promote to a king or another pawn. Usually, a pawn is promoted 
            to a queen, as the queen is the most powerful piece, but sometimes there is a good reason to promote to 
            a different piece such as a knight. It doesn't matter if you have all your pieces still on the board, 
            you can still promote to whatever piece you want, even if this means you have two or three queens on 
            the board at once.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On the board below, move the white pawn to the end of the board</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard p4"></div>

        <!--KNIGHTS-->
        <br><br><hr><br>
        <h1 id="knights">Piece introduction: Knights</h1>
        <br><hr><br>
        <br>
        <p>The pawn is seemingly the weakest of the bunch. However, its role in Chess is not to be
            underestimated. Each player starts the game with eight pawns on the second rank.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard n1"></div>
        <br>
        <h2>Knights: Movement</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The knight moves in an L-shape, either two squares vertically and one square horizontally, 
            or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. This means the knight has, at most, 
            eight possible squares it can jump to, as illustrated on the board below:</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard n2"></div>
        <br>
        <p>It doesn't matter if any of the intervening squares are occupied, the knight jumps over 
            everything in its path to land at its chosen destination. On the board below, take the 
            black knight and make a legal move:</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard n3"></div>
        <br>
        <h2>Knights: Capturing</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Unlike the pawn, the knight captures the same way as it moves. On the board below, use the white 
            knight to make a capture, but make sure you capture the right piece!</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard n4"></div>

        <!--BISHOPS-->
        <br><br><hr><br>
        <h1 id="bishops">Piece introduction: Bishops</h1>
        <br><hr><br>
        <br>
        <p>The Bishop is a long range piece that can be very powerful, but it has a significant weakness - 
            it can only ever move on squares of one colour. Each player starts the game with two bishops - 
            one that moves on light squares, and one that moves on dark squares - so between them, the two 
            bishops can cover all the squares on the board.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard b1"></div>
        <br>
        <h2>Bishops: Movement</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The bishop can move any number of squares in a straight diagonal line, so long as the squares 
            between the bishop and its destination are unoccupied. The diagram below shows the legal moves 
            for a bishop.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard b2"></div>
        <br>
        <p>Unlike the knight, the bishop cannot jump over obstacles, so if something is blocking its path, 
            the bishop can go no further. On the board below, drag the white bishop to make a legal move:</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard b3"></div>
        <br>
        <h2>Bishops: Capturing</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The bishop captures the same way it moves. On the diagram below, make a capture with the black bishop:</p>
        <br>
        <div class="chessboard b4"></div>

         <!--ROOKS-->
         <br><br><hr><br>
         <h1 id="rooks">Piece introduction: Rooks</h1>
         <br><hr><br>
         <br>
         <p>The rooks, which are also sometimes known as 'castles', are the second most powerful piece after the queen. 
             Like the bishop they are long range pieces, but they do not share the bishop's weakness and can reach every 
             square on the board. Because they start in the corners, rooks often don't join in the battle until after the 
             knights and bishops, but that also means they often survive much deeper into the game. In fact, the most 
             commonly occurring endgames in chess are endgames involving rooks! Each player starts the game with two rooks.</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard r1"></div>
         <br>
         <h2>Rooks: Movement</h2>
         <br>
         <p>The rook can move any number of squares in a straight line horizontally or vertically, so long as 
             none of the squares it passes through are occupied. The board below shows the legal moves for a rook:</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard r2"></div>
         <br>
         <p>Like the bishop, the rook can be blocked if other pieces get in its way. On the board below, make a legal 
             move with the white rook:</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard r3"></div>
         <br>
         <h2>Rooks: Capturing</h2>
         <br>
         <p>Rooks capture the same way they move. On the board below, drag the white rook to make a capture:</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard r4"></div>

         <!--QUEENS-->
         <br><br><hr><br>
         <h1 id="queens">Piece introduction: Queens</h1>
         <br><hr><br>
         <br>
         <p>The mighty queen is the most powerful piece on the chessboard, combining the powers of the rook and bishop. 
             Such is the queen's power, that the player who loses his or her queen is almost sure to lose the game as well. 
             No other piece rivals the speed and manoeuverability of the queen, and many games are often decided by a lightning 
             queen sortie. Each player starts the game with one queen.</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard q1"></div>
         <br>
         <h2>Queens: Movement</h2>
         <br>
         <p>The queen can move any number of squares in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In this way, 
             she combines the powers of the rook and bishop in a single piece. The legal moves of the queen are displayed on 
             the board below:</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard q2"></div>
         <br>
         <p>It might seem that the queen can do almost anything that another piece can, but there are limits to the queen's prowess. 
             Like the rook and bishop, she lacks the knight's ability to jump over obstacles, and so her routes must always be clear 
             of obstruction. Try making a legal move with the white queen on the board below:</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard q3"></div>
         <br>
         <h2>Queens: Capturing</h2>
         <br>
         <p>The queen captures the same way she moves. Drag the black queen to make a capture on the board below:</p>
         <br>

         <!--KINGS-->
         <br><br><hr><br>
         <h1 id="kings">Piece introduction: Kings</h1>
         <br><hr><br>
         <br>
         <p>The king is the most important piece in the game. You must keep your king safe at all costs, because if your 
             opponent traps your king, it's checkmate and you lose the game. Don't worry though, the king is not completely 
             helpless and he has an army of loyal pieces and pawns to protect him! Each player starts the game with one king, 
             and unlike the other pieces and pawns, the king is never captured and stays on the board for the whole game.</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard k1"></div>
         <br>
         <h2>Kings: Movement</h2>
         <br>
         <p>The king's movement is limited to one square in any direction, so he's not the fastest piece in the box. Still, 
            he is more powerful than a pawn, and he can give bishops and knights a run for their money too! The king's legal 
            moves are displayed on the board below:</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard k2"></div>

         <p>Despite his limited mobility, the king can still capture an enemy piece if he can catch up with them! Make a 
             capture with the white king on the board below:</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard k4"></div>
         <br>
         <p>Because the king is so important, you must never move him onto a square where he could be captured. This is 
             called moving into <b>check</b>, and is against the rules. If an enemy piece could move onto a square next turn, 
             then that square is off limits to the king. On the board below, the squares marked with an <b>X</b> are threatened 
             by black's bishop, so the white king may not move there:</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard k5"></div>
         <br>
         <p>Now try it for yourself - make a move with the black king on the board below, without moving him into check:</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard k6"></div>
         <br>
         <p>This also applies when the king is capturing a piece. If capturing an enemy piece would put him into check, 
             then that piece is off limits. Try making a capture with the white king on the board below, without moving him into check:</p>
         <br>
         <div class="chessboard k7"></div>
         <br>
         <p>Note that because the king can never move into check, this means that the two kings may never stand next to each other 
             - then both of them would be in check. The position on the board below is illegal:</p>
